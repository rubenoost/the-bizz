# Product Requirements Document: CarShare Tracker

## Overview
A free web app for small groups to fairly coordinate car sharing. Track rides, suggest drivers based on fairness, and schedule upcoming trips.

## Problem Statement
Groups who carpool (commuters, school runs, etc.) struggle to keep driving duties fair. Manual tracking is tedious, and there's no simple tool to coordinate who drives next.

## Target User
- Small groups (2-4 people) sharing regular rides
- Commuters, parents doing school runs, friends carpooling
- English-speaking markets
- Word-of-mouth acquisition

## Core Concepts

### Fairness Algorithm
Each member has a fairness ratio: `times_driven / (times_driven + times_passenger)`
- Goal: Keep all members at the same ratio
- Person with lowest ratio should drive next
- Naturally handles part-timers (fewer rides = smaller denominator)
- Drive multipliers allow weighting "expensive" drives (longer distance, bad traffic, etc.)

### Honour System
Users can override suggested drivers. Trust is implicit - you're sitting in the same car.

## Features (MVP)

### 1. Authentication
- Google login
- Apple login
- No email/password (keep it simple)

### 2. Groups
- Create a group (becomes admin)
- Invite via shareable link
- Max 4 members per group (free tier)
- Leave group functionality
- Admin can remove members

### 3. Routes
- Create routes within a group (e.g., "Home to Office")
- Max 2 routes per group (free tier)
- Each route has:
  - Name
  - Origin label (e.g., "Home")
  - Destination label (e.g., "Office")
  - Multiplier (default 1.0, for weighting fairness)

### 4. Recurring Rules
- Define recurring rides on routes
- Example: "Every weekday, Home → Office"
- Days of week selection
- Time of day
- Generates ride slots in calendar

### 5. Calendar & Signup
- View next 7-14 days of upcoming rides
- Members sign up for rides they can attend
- See who else is signed up
- System suggests fairest driver from signups
- One-way signup allowed (morning only, afternoon only)

### 6. Driver Suggestion
- From signed-up members, suggest person with lowest fairness ratio
- Display suggestion prominently
- Allow manual override (any signed-up member can be selected)

### 7. Ride Logging
- After ride occurs, log:
  - Date/time
  - Route
  - Driver (from group)
  - Passengers (from group, multi-select)
  - Optional: multiplier override
- Any group member can log rides

### 8. Dashboard
- Per-member stats:
  - Times driven
  - Times as passenger
  - Fairness ratio
  - Trend (improving/declining)
- Group fairness overview
- "Who should drive next" indicator

### 9. History
- List of all past rides
- Filter by date range, route, member
- Shows driver, passengers, date, route

## Non-Features (MVP)
- No notifications/reminders
- No mobile app (web only, mobile-responsive)
- No payments/paid tier
- No multiple groups per user (reconsider later)
- No ride editing after logging (delete and re-add)

## Future Paid Tier (Post-MVP)
- More than 4 members per group
- More than 2 routes per group
- Email/push notifications
- Advanced analytics

## Technical Constraints
- Budget: ~$20/month max
- Stack: Next.js, Cloudflare Pages, D1, Clerk
- Must work on mobile browsers

## Success Metrics
- Groups created
- Rides logged
- DAU/MAU
- Retention (groups still active after 30 days)

## Launch Strategy
- Word-of-mouth only
- English language only
- No marketing spend
